# Testing practice

by HÃ©ctor Gonzalez Orozco

Built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice) curriculum.

These exercises are made to learn the fundamentals of Test Driven Development using Jest. Each one involved making a function or object by adding elements that passed the tests.
